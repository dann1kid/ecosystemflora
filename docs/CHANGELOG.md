# Changelog — Ecosystem - Flora

Player-facing release notes. Dev history: [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md).

**Last public release:** **3.1.12** (ModDB)  
**This release:** **4.5.4**

Requirements: Vintage Story **1.22+**. Do not run alongside Wild Farming Revival.

---

## Unreleased — Tree spread guard

- **Meadow grass no longer replaces tree bases** — spread skips log-grown trunks, player saplings, and fruit-tree stems; sync spread re-checks the cell before `SetBlock`.
- Spread column cache clears when the player places a block nearby.

---

## Unreleased — Seasonal snow & fern saves

- **Winter snow on meadow plants** — phase/juvenile blocks swap `-free` / `-snow` from climate and snow layer; round-robin sync at runtime.
- **Brown sedge seasons** — dormant/dieback via tallgrass phenology (`sedgephase-*` blocks).
- **Fern phase save fix** — legacy `fernphase-*-dieback` codes restored (no `-free` suffix); chunk migration for mistaken `-free` variants.

---

- **Shipped CSV parity tests** — CI fails if `assets/ecosystemflora/species/ecology.csv` or `season.csv` drift from exporters (`tools/Export-SpeciesEcologyCsv.ps1`, `Export-SpeciesSeasonCsv.ps1`).
- **Load warnings** — duplicate species rows and unknown species in user ModConfig CSV (server log; unknown rows skipped).
- **`/ecospeciesreload`** — server admin command reloads merged ecology/season tables without world restart.
- Docs: client vs server inspect/handbook in [`SPECIES_ECOLOGY_CSV.md`](SPECIES_ECOLOGY_CSV.md).
- **`CONFIGURATION.md`** — complete reference for all **201** JSON keys (generated from `EcosystemConfig.cs` + config UI descriptions via `tools/generate_configuration_doc.py`).

---

## 4.5.3 — Wildgrass patch fixes

- **Wildgrass ecology patches** — `dependsOn` for `wildgrass` / `wildgrasscontinued`; `addmerge` instead of `add` on `/attributesByType`. Stops log spam when Wildgrass is not installed and avoids patch failures when the target file already has attributes.
- **Wildgrass handbook patches** — explicit per-species file paths instead of `plant/*` glob (nine blocktypes × two mod ids).
- Maintainer: `tools/generate_wildgrass_patches.py` regenerates both patch files.

---

## 4.5.0 — Species CSV tuning

**Since 4.4.1**

### Per-species balance in CSV

- Contract species (flowers, ferns, berries, trees, aquatic, …) read **`assets/ecosystemflora/species/ecology.csv`** and **`season.csv`** at load — not hardcoded C# tables at runtime.
- Server admins can override without recompiling:
  - `ModConfig/ecosystemflora/species/ecology.csv` — climate, spread rate, spacing, maturation hours, mat connectivity, …
  - `ModConfig/ecosystemflora/species/season.csv` — monthly spread/stress curves
- **Server:** folder and files are **created automatically** on first start; missing species rows appended on each start. **Restart world** to reload edits.
- **Partial rows OK:** leave cells empty to keep shipped defaults. New species rows auto-append when the mod updates.
- Handbook and **Inspect (I)** show merged registry values.
- Global vigor knob: **`SpeciesSpreadRateScale`** in JSON (default ~⅓; presets set lush/sparse scales). Per-species exceptions in CSV.
- Maintainer export: `tools/Export-SpeciesEcologyCsv.ps1`, `tools/Export-SpeciesSeasonCsv.ps1`. Details: [`SPECIES_ECOLOGY_CSV.md`](SPECIES_ECOLOGY_CSV.md).

**ModDB short paste**

```
4.5.0 — species CSV tuning (since 4.4.1)

• Runtime balance from shipped ecology.csv + season.csv. Server auto-creates ModConfig/ecosystemflora/species/ with editable CSVs; missing rows appended on update. Partial overrides OK — restart world to reload.

• Inspect (I) and handbook use merged tables. Global spread: SpeciesSpreadRateScale (~⅓ default).

Vintage Story 1.22+. Do not run alongside Wild Farming Revival.
```

---

## 4.4.1 — Spread balance and meadow harvest

**Since 4.3.4**

- **`SpeciesSpreadRateScale`** (~⅓ default) — global multiplier on all species spread rates; presets `natural` / `lush` / `sparse` set scale with attempts and fitness.
- Shore sedge (**brownsedge**) mat spread retuned for the slower default pace.
- Meadow **scythe harvest** fix — flowers/tallgrass drop drygrass reliably when using scythe on spread maturation blocks.

---

## 4.3.0 — Berry colony ecology

**Since 4.2.0**

### Species-specific spread

- Wild berries now expand as **colonies**: one mat step from the patch edge (rhizome, root suckers, or stolons). Currants, strawberry, cloudberry, and others also use occasional **seed jumps** (reuses `RhizomeSeedDispersal*` settings).
- **Blueberry** and **cranberry** — forest/bog rhizome mats; no tree-host symbiosis.
- **Raspberry / blackberry** — aggressive edge thickets (blackberry uses eight-connected mat for tip rooting).
- **Strawberry** — forest-clearing runners + seed.
- **Beautyberry** — seed shrub; radius search, no mat.
- Per-species **context** (Forest / Edge / Open) and **moisture/light niche** profiles updated.
- Toggle: `EnableBerryColonySpread` (default on). **Inspect (I)** shows berry colony spread mode.

---

## 4.2.0 — Simulation visibility and ecology parity

**Since 4.1.5**

### Fern phenology

- Five fern species now follow **dormant → sporulating → dieback** phases (like meadow flowers), with new `fernphase-*` blocks for off-season and stressed visuals.
- **Orphan symbionts** (host tree gone) sync to dieback under stress instead of vanishing instantly.
- Spread is **gated** outside the sporulation season and while a fern is dormant or in dieback.
- **Inspect (I)** shows fern phase and sporulation status.
- Toggle: `EnableFernPhenology` (default on). Asset generator: `tools/GenerateFernPhaseBlocks.ps1`.

### Tallgrass phenology

- Tallgrass gets **winter dormant** and **stress dieback** phase blocks (`tallgrassphase-dormant-free`, `tallgrassphase-dieback-free`).
- Spread stops in dormant and dieback, matching the flower/fern pipeline.
- **Inspect (I)** shows tallgrass phase.
- Toggle: `EnableTallgrassPhenology` (default on).

### Berry spread maturation

- Wild berry bushes spawned by spread now **reset through cutting state** and enter the registry only when calendar-mature (same maturation idea as flowers/ferns).
- Density tuned for **blackberry, raspberry, and currants** so patches read more natural, not instant carpets.
- Toggle: `EnableBerrySpreadMaturation` (default on).

### Stump decay

- After tree senescence, standing **snag stumps** can schedule removal after a configurable number of **game years** (persisted in save data).
- Toggle: `EnableStumpDecay` (default on). Years: `StumpDecayYears` (default 10).

### Ecology history in inspect

- Recent ecology events for the aimed block — **orphan dieback**, **stress death**, **spread** — appear at the bottom of the **I** inspect report (up to three lines, ~14-day memory).
- No separate hotkey; history is part of inspect when `EnableEcologyHistoryHint` is on (default).

### Handbook

- Cross-links between ecology handbook pages (Overview, Inspect, Trees, Canopy, Configuration) use explicit `handbook://` URLs so links work in **en** and **ru**.
- Config key names in handbook text are plain bold labels, not broken pseudo-links.

### Presets and defaults

- New balance preset **`vanilla-minimal`** — disables juvenile spread maturation and phenology systems for a lighter “mostly vanilla” feel.
- Optional custom JSON presets in `ModConfig/ecosystemflora.presets/*.json`.
- **`ApplyCrossHabitatSpacing`** now defaults to **true** — meadow flowers/grass and shore/aquatic plants compete in the same spacing index where configured.

### Mycelium (aligned with 4.1.5)

- Felling a host tree **no longer instantly removes** linked mycelium. Tree removal is **notify-only**; anchors build stress and fade on the normal cadence, like ferns and berries.

---

```

---

## 4.1.5 — Symbiosis orphans fade via stress, not instant cascade

- **Fix (symbiosis):** removing a tree or other symbiosis host no longer mass-kills linked understory plants in one frame. Host removal only invalidates the host cache and wakes nearby ecology; orphaned symbionts (ferns, bluebells, berries, …) accumulate failed stress checks on the normal recheck cadence (~3–4 game days at defaults) and then die with the usual Death soil impulse. Aligns with impulse-only simulation — no ambient soil pass, no instant script cascade.

---

## 4.1.4 — Fast registration for flora placed near players

- **Fix (registration):** flora added to an already-scanned chunk without a normal place event (worldedit / fill / other mods) no longer takes minutes to enter the registry. A chunk's load-time scan marked it complete and nothing re-ran the fast scan afterwards, so discovery fell to the slow cyclic column crawler round-robining every active chunk (≈225 at default radius) at 32 columns/tick. The chunks immediately around each player are now re-enqueued into the fast background scan on a short cadence, so near-player edits register within a couple seconds. Hand-placed blocks were always instant (place event) and are unchanged.
- **Fix (rescan):** the cyclic flora rescanner no longer discards all per-chunk column progress whenever the active-chunk set changes (e.g. the player walks across a chunk border); it keeps cursors for chunks that stayed active, matching the tree rescanner.

---

## 4.1.3 — Fix runaway tallgrass spread

- **Fix (spread):** a single planted clump no longer carpets everything around it within a minute. Spreaders without a maturation cooldown (tallgrass especially, with its zero spacing and high spread rate) were re-triggered every reproduce tick by the event-wake path, which bypasses the calendar interval and was gated only by a spawn cooldown they never set. They now floor that cooldown to their own calendar interval, so event-wake can never spread faster than the scheduled cadence. Flowers and ferns are unchanged (their policies already set the cooldown).

---

## 4.0.2 — Soil succession + flower parity

- **Fix (soil):** meadow and understory spread no longer creates `forestfloor-*` from `soil-*`. Litter layer stays on existing forest floor (worldgen / canopy); plants only shift soil fertility and moisture tiers.
- **Hart's-tongue:** wetland herb role (not forest understory); no tree-symbiosis gate — open wet meadows only, no podzol conversion. Wetland spread raises soil moisture only (no peat creation).
- **Catmint / redtopgrass:** same spread-maturation and phenology pipeline as other meadow flowers; texture paths aligned with vanilla (`petal/catmint`, `redtopgrass1/2/3`).
- **Ferns:** rhizome mat spread (patch edge step), seasonal sporulation gate, juvenile spread maturation + post-attempt cooldown; inspect shows frontier / sporulation / maturing seedling. Species differentiated by temperature/rain envelopes, niche, and season curves (eagle/cinnamon/deer/tall/hartstongue).
- **Tests:** `WildSoilBlockMapperTests`, `FlowerSpreadAssetParityTests`, `FernSpreadTests` guard regressions.

---

## 3.9.24 — Meadow flower phenology (simulation-first)

- **Phases:** dormant → vegetative → bloom → dieback driven by `WildSpeciesSeason`, local temperature, and per-plant bloom energy. Spread and hand harvest only in **bloom**; inspect (I) shows phase, energy, and bloom ETA.
- **Visuals:** 72 full-size `flowerphase-*` blocktypes (24 meadow species × 3 non-bloom phases) plus bloom = vanilla `flower-*`. Spread seedlings stay on small `juvenile-flower-*`.
- **Assets:** `tools/GenerateFlowerPhaseBlocks.ps1` — petal textures with phase tint (fixes transparent dormant/dieback on heather and similar); dedicated rafflesia `inside`/`petals` overrides; block lang `block-flowerphase-*` / `block-juvenile-flower-*` in en/ru/de.
- **Config:** `EnableFlowerPhenology` (default on) and bloom temperature/energy keys in settings UI. Docs: [`FLOWER_PHENOLOGY.md`](FLOWER_PHENOLOGY.md).

---

## 3.9.23 — Juvenile flower texture fix

- **Fix:** spread seedlings for catmint, wild daisy, forget-me-not, edelweiss, heather, and western gorse now use vanilla texture paths (catmint has a single `petal/catmint` file; two-variant species no longer reference missing `*3` assets).
- **Tooling:** `GenerateJuvenileFlowerBlocks.ps1` — `WildcardSingle24` and `TwoVariant16/24` helpers mirror vanilla `texturesByType` groups.

---

- **Fix:** flower spread cooldown now applies when two-phase placement enqueues candidates but every commit fails revalidation.
- **Inspect (I):** last spread channel on registered plants (rhizome mat / seed jump / radius / failure reason).
- **Docs:** `GAPS.md` reframed — shallow-water colonization is natural; aquatic gaps are model/tempo consistency, not “slow down crowfoot”.

---

## 3.9.20 — Flower spread maturation (all meadow flowers)

- **Juvenile spread** for all 23 meadow flower species plus redtopgrass; maturation queue and inspect on establishing seedlings.
- **Spread-attempt cooldown** on placement commit (not background queue); separate `EnableFlowerSpreadAttemptCooldown` and `FlowerSpreadCooldownHoursMultiplier`.
- **Failed chance roll** applies a short parent pause (~3 h) to reduce event-wake spam.
- **Assets:** croton/rafflesia juveniles use vanilla shapes; variant-aware maturation for lupine, croton, and rafflesia.
- **Support:** one-time log when a juvenile blocktype is missing; `EcologyGrassColonizerSpecies` for redtopgrass; integration tests and doc updates.

---

## 3.9.16 — Branchy-first seasonal canopy (Option B)

**Canopy:** Spring leaf dress only from existing branchy skeleton (not from bare log); new branches via tree aging and rare winter skeleton repair. Autumn strip is patchy with a soft periphery-first bias; spring dress favors the inner crown first.

---

## 3.9.15 — Seasonal foliage regrowth fix

**Fix:** Breaking deciduous leaves no longer triggers immediate chunk foliage resync and catch-up budding (aggressive regrowth at tree bases, especially birch/maple). Player-cleared cells suppress seasonal buds for ~10 game days as a safety net for hybrid/random modes and tree aging.

---

## 3.9.14

**Performance:** Background spread scoring for meadow plants, reed/lily mats, and water crowfoot (default **on**). Per-chunk spread scheduling and chunk-based event wake.

**Fixes:** Catmint spreads in open meadows and keeps meadow soil (no forest floor under the plant). Tallgrass spreads only after half its local target height; growth continues to full height.

**Optional:** `EnableReproduceTickProfiling` for spread/worker debug logs.

Short ModDB copy: [`RELEASE_3.9.14.md`](RELEASE_3.9.14.md).

---

## 3.9.13 — Mat spread workers + per-chunk due heap (Phase 6.11 + 6.2)

### Mat / rhizome / lily pad spread on workers (6.11)

- **`EnableBackgroundSpreadSolve`** now covers **rhizome mat** (reeds) and **surface mat** (lilies) when two-phase spread is on — same snapshot → worker → `PendingSpreadQueue` pipeline as terrestrial meadow spread.
- Main thread still runs frontier checks, water placement, vacancy, and spacing; worker scores mat candidates only.
- Not covered at release time: water crowfoot (added in **3.9.14**), vines, mycelium.

### Per-chunk due scheduling (6.2)

- **`ProcessDue`** (when chunk-fair spread is off) now uses the **chunk round-robin executor** with **per-chunk due min-heaps** instead of a global due list scan.
- Wake vs calendar classification unchanged.

See [`PHASE6_SIMULATION.md`](PHASE6_SIMULATION.md) §6.11–§6.2.

---

## 3.9.12 — Reproduce tick profiling (Phase 6.10)

- **`EnableReproduceTickProfiling`** — second log line: chunk-fair spread stats, wake vs calendar attempts, background spread worker queue, pending spread commits, column cache hit rate (interval delta).
- See [`PHASE6_SIMULATION.md`](PHASE6_SIMULATION.md) §6.10.

---

## 3.9.11 — Empty-first spread on worker path (Phase 6.9)

- **Background spread solve** now mirrors sync **empty-first** collect when `EnableEmptyFirstSpreadCollect` is on: worker runs `EmptyOnly` scoring first, then `DisplacementOnly` only if no empty winner qualifies.
- Removes the v3.9.10 limitation that forced sync spread for default meadow displacement settings.
- See [`PHASE6_SIMULATION.md`](PHASE6_SIMULATION.md) §6.9.

---

## 3.9.10 — Background spread solve + cyclic flora discovery

### Background spread scoring (opt-in)

- **`EnableBackgroundSpreadSolve`** (default **off**) — main thread captures compact **`SpreadSolveCell`** snapshots (surface, soil, climate, niche, spacing); **worker threads** score fitness and pick spread targets; **`SetBlock`** still runs on the main thread via the existing **`PendingSpreadQueue`** commit pass.
- Requires **`EnableTwoPhaseSpreadPlacement`** (default on). **Terrestrial** meadow spread only — not rhizome/reed mat, surface-mat lilies, vines, or mycelium network.
- **Empty-first** (`EnableEmptyFirstSpreadCollect`, default on) — supported on worker path since **3.9.11** (Phase 6.9).
- **`SpreadWorkerCount`** — background scorer threads (0 = half CPU cores, max 8). See [`PHASE6_SIMULATION.md`](PHASE6_SIMULATION.md) §6.8.

### Cyclic flora discovery

- **`EnableCyclicFloraDiscovery`** (default **on**) — round-robin **live** column rescan for flowers and tallgrass after chunk load (mirrors cyclic tree trunk discovery). Fixes flora missed by one-shot background registration when heightmap or load order hid plants.
- **`MaxFloraRescanColumnsPerTick`** (default **32**) — columns rescanned per chunk-scan tick.
- Worker registration hits can be **supplemented** with a live rescan when the snapshot pass returns zero flora (`FloraColumnDiscovery`).

### Tests

- **`SpreadSolverTests`** — worker-safe scoring unit tests.

### Кратко (RU)

- **Фоновый spread solve** (opt-in) — main собирает `SpreadSolveCell`, worker считает fitness и выбирает клетку; `SetBlock` на main через `PendingSpreadQueue`. Только terrestrial, нужен two-phase spread.
- **Cyclic flora** — live rescan цветов/травы после load (как cyclic trees); дополняет one-shot background registration.

---

## 3.9.9 — Tallgrass stage advance

- **Fix:** veryshort spread turf did not grow in vanilla — mod now advances **veryshort → short** on a calendar timer (`GrowthHoursMultiplier`), then registers for spread.
- See [`TALLGRASS_SPREAD_MATURATION.md`](TALLGRASS_SPREAD_MATURATION.md).

---

## 3.9.8 — Server crash fix + config UI copy

- **Fix:** register `ecosystemHandbook` with `RegisterCollectibleBehaviorClass` (required on VS 1.22+ dedicated servers).
- **Config UI (RU):** shorter maturation field labels and tooltips without anglicisms.

---

## 3.9.7 — Tallgrass spread maturation

- **Veryshort spread** — meadow tallgrass spread places **veryshort** turf (cover/snow/free preserved); vanilla grass growth raises height before the patch spreads again from that cell.
- **Spread gate** — ecology registration and parent spread only from **short** and taller; `veryshort` and eaten grass do not reproduce.
- **`EnableTallgrassSpreadMaturation`** — turn off to restore legacy spread height selection at commit time.
- Design doc: [`TALLGRASS_SPREAD_MATURATION.md`](TALLGRASS_SPREAD_MATURATION.md).

---

## 3.9.6 — Flower spread maturation

- **Juvenile spread** — colonizer meadow flowers (cow parsley, horsetail, mugwort, lupine, woad, red top grass, heather, western gorse) spread as a **small establishing plant**, then mature into the vanilla parent after a calendar delay.
- **`GrowthHoursMultiplier`** — now controls juvenile → mature pace (higher = faster).
- **Post-spawn cooldown** — parents wait after a successful offspring before spreading again; event wake no longer bypasses this floor.
- **`EnableFlowerSpreadMaturation`** — turn off to restore instant mature spread for all flowers.
- Design doc: [`FLOWER_SPREAD_MATURATION.md`](FLOWER_SPREAD_MATURATION.md).

---

## 3.9.4 — patch fixes (VS 1.22)

- **Handbook JSON patches** — `addmerge` on `/behaviors` (and `behaviorsByType` for tallgrass) instead of `/behaviors/-`; fixes errors on blocktypes without a root `behaviors` array.
- **Vanilla asset paths** — reeds → `reedpapyrus.json`; water crowfoot → `aquatic/watercrowfoot.json`; berries/saplings → `fruitingbush.json` / `plaintreesapling.json`.
- **Server-side patching** — `"side": "server"` on blocktype/item patches (no client “file not found” spam).
- **Wildgrass handbook** — same `addmerge` fix; `dependsOn` for `wildgrass` / `wildgrasscontinued`.

---

## 3.9.3 — Wildgrass Fork (optional)

- JSON patches register nine **Wildgrass** / **Wildgrass Fork** species (`wildgrass:*`) as third-party ecology participants when that mod is installed (`EnableThirdPartyParticipants`, default on).
- Mature growth stages spread; climate tuned from Wildgrass worldgen; harvest left to Wildgrass (`ecologyMeadowHarvest: none`).

---

## 3.8.0 — short (EN)

**Since 3.7.0**

- **Phase 6 simulation** — ecology runs in all loaded chunks: chunk-fair spread, wake on world changes, column cache, two-phase placement, monthly wake for seasonal species.
- **Faster registration** — player-vicinity priority (16-block radius), burst on chunk load, background column scan on a worker thread, paced registry apply (no more “lost tail” flora).
- **Vines & mushrooms** — wild vine tips and vanilla mycelium anchors register on chunk load and run in the same reproduce loop (chunk-fair spread, stress, inspect **I**) as meadow flora.
- **Seasonal trees** — deciduous canopy still strips/buds on the main thread; autumn branchy strip can drop `loosestick-free` on the ground.
- **Spread perf** — empty cells first; displacement when no vacancy; skip occupied columns on empty-first pass.
- **Tick desync** — reproduce 2 s, chunk scan 2.3 s, stress 5.5 s (fewer aligned server spikes).
- **Canopy sticks** — autumn branchy strip drops `loosestick-free` on the surface below (not floating on tallgrass).
- **Break wake** — breaking blocks with no ecology participant and no forest-context semantics (e.g. `loosestick-free`) no longer wakes neighbors; breaking leaves or tree logs still can.
- **Flora (3.7.1)** — red top grass colonizer, brown sedge, croton, rafflesias, cacti, frosted tallgrass profiles.
- Handbook updated (en/ru). Press **I** for ecology inspect.

## Since 3.7.0 — at a glance

| Area | What you get |
|------|----------------|
| **Simulation engine** | Chunk-fair spread across loaded chunks; event wake on break/place/displacement; column cache; two-phase evaluate/commit; monthly wake for seasonal species |
| **Registration** | Priority + burst near players; background column scan; paced registry apply; **vines** (column pass) + **mycelium anchors** (chunk BE scan) on load; seasonal foliage sync on main thread |
| **Spread perf** | Empty cells scanned first with full fitness; displacement still runs when no vacancy; column occupancy hint skips known plant columns |
| **Perf & fixes** | Desynced tick intervals; fallen sticks on ground surface; reduced wake on breaks without ecology/forest context (e.g. loose sticks) |
| **Handbook** | Configuration guide updated (en/ru) for v3.8 keys |
| **Tests** | 332 unit tests |

---

## 3.8.0 — Simulation engine (Phase 6)

Full ecology in **all loaded chunks** without geographic cutoffs. Smarter scheduling instead of throttling scope.

### Spread scheduling

- **Chunk-fair spread** — round-robin across ecology registry chunks (`EnableChunkFairSpread`, default on).
- **Event wake** — neighbors retry spread after breaks, placement, displacement, soil succession (`EnableEventDrivenSpread`).
- **Column cache** — spread preflight reads `SpreadColumnSnapshot` (`EnableEcologyColumnCache`).
- **Two-phase placement** — evaluate candidates without `SetBlock`, then chunk-fair commit with revalidation (`EnableTwoPhaseSpreadPlacement`). Applies to terrestrial/aquatic mat spread via `TrySpawnOffspring`; **mycelium network** and **wild vines** commit directly in the reproduce callback.
- **Season coarse wake** — seasonal species wake each in-game month (`EnableSeasonCoarseWake`).

Break turf or fell a tree — the meadow reacts within a couple of spread ticks.

### Registration (deferred chunk scan)

When you explore, flora registers incrementally. New in 3.8:

- **Priority queue** — chunks within `PlayerRegistrationPriorityRadiusBlocks` (default 16) drain before the background queue (`EnablePlayerPriorityRegistration`).
- **Burst on load** — one nearby chunk can finish registration in a single callback (`EnableBurstRegistrationNearPlayers`, ~80 ms scan budget).
- **Paced registry apply** — column scan collects hits into a pending queue; up to 512–2048 `RegisterReproducer` calls per tick (priority first). Fixes “lost tail” flora when scan budget ran out mid-chunk.
- **Background column scan** — main thread copies block ids into a chunk snapshot; flower / vine / tree classification runs on a dedicated worker thread (`EnableBackgroundRegistrationScan`).
- **Mycelium on chunk load** — vanilla `BlockEntityMycelium` anchors register via `MyceliumChunkRegistrar` on the same chunk-load path as vines (BE scan on main; then network spread + stress like vines in the reproduce tick).
- **Seasonal foliage (chunk mode)** — when background scan is on, canopy strip/bud runs in a separate main-thread pass (`FoliageCellScheduler.ProcessChunkSyncBatch` / `FoliageChunkSyncPass`), not on the worker.

Distant loaded chunks still register in the background — full scope, faster where you stand.

### Perf & correctness

- **Desynced ticks** — `ReproduceTickIntervalMs` 2000, `ChunkScanTickIntervalMs` 2300, `StressTickIntervalMs` 5500 (intervals not multiples of each other → less aligned CPU spikes).
- **Priority radius** — default **16** blocks (was 384); **burst** scan budget **80** ms per nearby chunk load.
- **Fallen sticks** — autumn branchy leaf strip can drop `loosestick-free`; placement uses surface search below the crown (not on tallgrass mid-air).
- **Break wake** — no ecology wake when the broken block is not an ecology plant, not in the registry, not a forest-context block (`log-grown`, `leaves-*`, ferntree trunk, …), and not an event-driven wake target (e.g. picking up `loosestick-free`).

### Spread collect (terrestrial)

- **Empty-first** — scan empty/vacancy cells with full fitness first (`EnableEmptyFirstSpreadCollect`). **Displacement is unchanged** when no empty cell qualifies.
- **Occupancy hint** — spacing index tracks occupied XZ columns per chunk; empty-first pass skips them before expensive placement (`EnableSpreadColumnOccupancyHint`).

Not applied to turf colonizers, mat spread (reeds/lilies), or habitats without displacement.

## Кратко — с 3.7.0 до 3.8.0 (RU)

**Базовый релиз:** 3.7.0 (папоротник-дерево, крона, лианы). **Этот релиз:** 3.8.0.

### Контент (3.7.1)

- **Red top grass** — колонизатор луга, конкурирует с tallgrass (не «цветок луга»).
- **Brown sedge**, croton, rafflesias, barrel/silver-torch cactus, frosted tallgrass — полные ecology-профили.
- Turf colonizers без бонуса на пустые клетки — захват существующей травы.

### Симуляция (Phase 6)

- Spread **по чанкам** + **пробуждение** от изменений мира; двухфазный commit; coarse wake сезонных видов.
- **Быстрая регистрация** рядом с игроком (priority + burst + фоновый скан колонок; paced apply).
- **Лианы и грибница** — регистрация при load чанка; spread/stress/inspect (I) в том же reproduce loop, что и луг.
- **Сезонная крона** — отдельный foliage-pass на main при фоновой регистрации.
- **Empty-first spread** — пустые клетки первыми; **displacement** если vacancy нет.
- **Perf** — desynced ticks (2 s / 2.3 s / 5.5 s); палки на поверхности земли; меньше wake при ломании блоков без ecology/forest-context (напр. `loosestick-free`; листва и брёвна — по-прежнему могут будить).

Handbook (en/ru). VS 1.22+. Не совместим с Wild Farming Revival.

## ModDB paste — 3.8.0 update text

```
Since 3.7.0 → 3.8.0

FLORA (3.7.1)
• Red top grass — meadow colonizer, competes with tallgrass.
• Brown sedge, croton, rafflesias, cacti, frosted tallgrass — full ecology profiles.
• Turf colonizers skip empty-cell bonus — invade existing grass, not garden fill.

SIMULATION (Phase 6)
• Chunk-fair spread + event wake on break/place/displacement.
• Two-phase placement, column cache, monthly wake for seasonal species.
• Fast registration near you (priority queue + burst + background column scan).
• Vines and mycelium anchors register on chunk load; same reproduce loop as meadow flora.
• Seasonal canopy sync on main thread when background scan is enabled.
• Empty-first spread; displacement when no empty cell. Column occupancy hint.
• Desynced tick intervals (2 s / 2.3 s / 5.5 s). Fallen sticks land on ground surface. Less ecology wake when breaking blocks without ecology or forest context (e.g. loose sticks).

Handbook updated (en/ru). Press I for ecology inspect.
VS 1.22+. Do not run alongside Wild Farming Revival.

## 3.7.0 — Tree fern, canopy sticks, wild vines

### Tree fern (`ferntree-normal-*`)

Tropical arborescent fern columns — **not** lumber trees (`log-grown`) and **not** ground ferns (`fern-*`).

- Chunk scan registers trunk base at calendar age **0** (`EnableFerntreeEcology`).
- Yearly aging: crown top young → medium → old; slow height growth every few years.
- Spread places a **young column** (trunk + top-young + side foliage) near mature trunks.
- Phased senescence after ~80 years: foliage → crown removal → snag (`FerntreeSenescenceSnagSegments`) → column cleared.
- Counts as **tree host** for symbiotic ferns and forest context.
- Inspect (**I**) on any ferntree block → trunk base age, segments, crown maturity, senescence phase.

See [`FERNTREE.md`](FERNTREE.md).

### Canopy phenology enhancements

On top of **3.2** seasonal strip/bud:

- **Partial branchy autumn strip** — `FoliagePeakAutumnBranchyStripActivity` default **0.35** (was 0 = keep all branchy).
- **Fallen sticks** — stripping `leavesbranchy` may drop `loosestick-free` on the ground below (`EnableCanopyFallenSticks`, `CanopyFallenStickChance`).
- **Age-scaled spring branches** — older registered trees bud more `leavesbranchy` in spring from calendar age at trunk base (`EnableSpringBranchyAgeBoost`, `SpringBranchyAgeBoostYearsToMax`, `SpringBranchyAgeBoostMax`).

### Wild vines

Vanilla `wildvine-end-*` and `wildvine-tropical-end-*` tips join the reproduce loop (`EnableWildVineEcology`):

1. **Extend down** — air below tip → new end; former tip → section.
2. **Wall capture** — scan adjacent vertical faces of buildings and trunks (`WildVineWallCaptureRadius`, `WildVineWallCaptureHeight`).

See [`WILD_VINE.md`](WILD_VINE.md).

### Config (new keys)

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|:-------:|---------|
| `EnableFerntreeEcology` | true | Tree fern register, spread, aging |
| `FerntreeSenescenceSnagSegments` | 2 | Snag trunk height (ferntree) |
| `FoliagePeakAutumnBranchyStripActivity` | 0.35 | Partial branchy strip threshold |
| `EnableCanopyFallenSticks` | true | Drop sticks when branchy strips |
| `CanopyFallenStickChance` | 0.42 | Stick drop chance scale |
| `EnableSpringBranchyAgeBoost` | true | Spring branchy buds × tree age |
| `SpringBranchyAgeBoostYearsToMax` | 60 | Years to max branch boost |
| `SpringBranchyAgeBoostMax` | 1.5 | Max spring branchy multiplier |
| `EnableWildVineEcology` | true | Vine tip spread |
| `WildVineWallCaptureRadius` | 4 | Horizontal wall scan |
| `WildVineWallCaptureHeight` | 6 | Vertical wall scan |

## Since 3.1.12 — at a glance (3.6 baseline)

| Area | What you get |
|------|----------------|
| **Trees** | Calendar age, slow yearly growth, phased senescence death (4 years), age saved in the world |
| **Canopy** | Deciduous autumn leaf drop and spring bud on existing log-grown trees; optional leaf particles under tall crowns |
| **Handbook** | Nine en/ru guide pages rewritten (overview, species groups, trees, canopy, inspect, config) |
| **Inspect (I)** | Trunk logs show age, structure size, senescence horizon (same key as flowers, reeds, mycelium) |
| **Config** | New toggles for tree aging, senescence, seasonal foliage, canopy ambience; `OnlyActivateNearPlayers` now defaults to **false** |

Press **I** on wild plants, mushroom caps, mycelium soil, or trunk logs. Enable **`VerboseLogging`** + **`ReproduceDebug`** in `ecosystemflora.json` for server log detail.

## 3.6.0 — Wild tree maturation

Registered wild trees (`log-grown` trunk base in the ecology registry) now have a **life cycle** beyond sapling spread. See [`TREE_AGING.md`](TREE_AGING.md) for the full end-to-end table.

### Full lifecycle

1. Mature trunk **spreads** a free sapling (winter off; not on ice/snow).
2. **Vanilla treegen** grows it; ecology **registers** the trunk base at calendar age **0**.
3. Each game year: **age +1**, optional structure growth, **sapling spread** (trunks never stress-die).
4. After species lifespan: **four senescence years** → stump + fallen debarked logs (or air if remains off).
5. **Neighbouring trees** refill the gap — no sapling burst on death.

### Calendar age and growth

- Each **game year**, registered trunks gain one calendar year and may add vanilla **log-grown**, **leavesbranchy**, or **leaves-grown** blocks.
- **Structure size** (trunk height, crown radius) and **calendar age** are separate: a worldgen giant can look tall at age 0 and will not die just because it looks mature.
- Growth respects map height, land claims, and physical vacancy — no custom block IDs.

### Senescence (phased death of old age)

- After lifespan, **four game years**: strip crown leaves → strip branchy skeleton → short dry trunk (snag, default 3 blocks) → **stump + fallen logs** (vanilla `log-*`, choppable; not re-registered as wild trees).
- Sapling spread and growth stop once senescence begins; spring canopy bud is blocked.
- Toggle: `EnableTreeSenescence` (default **on**). Snag height: `TreeSenescenceSnagBlocks`. Remains: `EnableTreeSenescenceRemains` (default **on**), `TreeSenescenceFallenLogCount` (default **3**, 0 = stump only). Set remains off for bare air removal. Blocked inside land claims.
- Master toggle: `EnableTreeAging` (default **on**). Turn off both to keep pre-3.6 tree behaviour (sapling spread only).

### Persistence

- Calendar age is **stored in the savegame** and restored when the chunk rescans the trunk after a server restart.
- Open **Inspect (I)** on any trunk log after reload to confirm age and structure.

### Inspect (I) on trunk logs

- Any `log-grown` block on the tree shows the same profile (resolved via trunk base).
- Lines include calendar age, structure vs typical mature for the species, and senescence horizon.
- Climate, soil, and niche are sampled at the **root base**, not mid-trunk.

### Config (new keys)

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|:-------:|---------|
| `EnableTreeAging` | true | Yearly age + structure growth |
| `EnableTreeSenescence` | true | Phased death after lifespan |
| `TreeSenescenceSnagBlocks` | 3 | Trunk blocks during snag year |
| `EnableTreeSenescenceRemains` | true | Stump + fallen logs on final year |
| `TreeSenescenceFallenLogCount` | 3 | Ground logs near stump (0 = stump only) |
| `MaxTreeGrowthAttemptsPerTick` | 6 | Server tick budget for growth |
| `TreeGrowthActivityScale` | 1.0 | Pacing multiplier |

### Handbook (en / ru)

Nine in-game pages rewritten in plain language:

- Overview, Flowers, Ferns, Trees, Berries, Aquatic plants  
- Seasonal Canopy, Ecology Inspect, Configuration Guide  

Per-species numbers remain on vanilla block handbook pages and in the inspect dialog.

### Ecology scope default

- `OnlyActivateNearPlayers` defaults to **false** — ecology runs on all plants in **loaded chunks** (normal multiplayer and exploration).
- Set **true** only for local perf testing (~192 blocks from players). Old configs that still have `true` will behave as before until you edit the file; deleting the key lets the mod rewrite the default on next load.

---

## 3.5.0 — Canopy ambience

Client-side atmosphere under tall deciduous crowns — no server load, no save data.

- Subtle **green motes** under canopy in spring and summer; **falling leaf drift** in autumn (species-tinted colours).
- Respects view distance, particle settings, and optional rain suppression (`CanopyAmbienceSuppressInRain`).
- Toggle: `EnableCanopyAmbience` (default **on**).
- Autumn crown sync fix for mixed foliage states after seasonal strip/bud.

---

## 3.2.0 — Seasonal canopy phenology

Deciduous **log-grown** trees change crown foliage with the calendar — still vanilla blocks, no new IDs, no disk persistence.

### Autumn

- **`leaves-grown`** strips to air (partial defoliation — patchy crowns, not every leaf at once).
- **`leavesbranchy`** may thin at peak autumn depending on species curve.

### Spring

- **`log-grown`** and **`leavesbranchy`** bud into adjacent air → new branchy / leaf blocks.
- Only orthogonal neighbors; same wood type; land claims respected.

### How it works

- Per-cell rules synced on chunk load, month change, and nearby block updates.
- Deciduous species only; conifers unchanged.
- Toggle: `EnableSeasonalFoliage` (default **on**).

Works together with **3.5** ambience particles for a visible seasonal forest.

---

## Unchanged since 3.1.12 (reminder)

Still in the mod from earlier releases — no need to re-read if you already play 3.1.12:

- Mycelium ecology around vanilla mushroom anchors (niche, stress, network spread, inspect on caps and soil)
- Reed / tule / papyrus **mat edge** spread + rare seed jumps; water lily **pad mat**
- Meadow harvest (empty hand → block; knife/scythe → drygrass)
- Soil succession, symbiosis, displacement, seasonal spread for flowers/ferns/berries
- Third-party plants via JSON `ecologyParticipant`
- Config auto-merge — missing keys added to `ModConfig/ecosystemflora.json` on startup

---

## Кратко — с 3.6.0 до 3.7.0 (RU)

**Базовый релиз:** 3.6.0 (деревья, крона, справочник). **Этот релиз:** 3.7.0.

### Древовидный папоротник (`ferntree`)

- Регистрация колонны `ferntree-normal-trunk`, календарный возраст, рост кроны и высоты.
- Spread молодой колонны; phased senescence (~80 лет).
- Хост для симбиоза и лесного контекста. Осмотр **I**. [`FERNTREE.md`](FERNTREE.md).

### Крона (дополнение к 3.2)

- Частичное снятие `leavesbranchy` осенью (порог **0.35**).
- Палки `loosestick-free` под кроной при снятии ветвистой листвы.
- Весной больше почек `leavesbranchy` у **старых** деревьев (по `TreeAgeYears`).

### Дикие лианы

- Кончики `wildvine-end-*` растут **вниз** и захватывают соседние вертикальные грани. [`WILD_VINE.md`](WILD_VINE.md).

### Деревья (уточнение 3.6)

- Финальный год senescence: пень + брёвна (`TreeDecayRemains`) — реализация закреплена в коде.

---

## Кратко — с 3.1.12 до 3.6.0 (RU)

**Последняя публикация на ModDB:** 3.1.12. **Этот релиз:** 3.6.0.

### Деревья (3.6)

- Зарегистрированные дикие стволы получают **календарный возраст** раз в игровой год и могут медленно наращивать ствол и крону (ванильные блоки).
- **Размер и возраст разделены:** высокое дерево из генерации мира может быть «молодым» по календарю.
- В конце жизни вида — **четыре игровых года**: листва кроны → ветвистый остов → короткий сухой ствол (snag) → **пень и брёвна** (ванильные `log-*`, можно рубить; экология их не регистрирует). Spread саженцев останавливается; весенний bud кроны заблокирован. Ключи: `EnableTreeSenescenceRemains`, `TreeSenescenceFallenLogCount`.
- Возраст и **фаза senescence** сохраняются в мире и восстанавливаются после перезапуска сервера.
- **Осмотр (I)** на любом бревне ствола: возраст, размер, текущая фаза упадка.
- Ключи: `EnableTreeAging`, `EnableTreeSenescence`, `TreeSenescenceSnagBlocks`, `MaxTreeGrowthAttemptsPerTick`, `TreeGrowthActivityScale`.

### Сезонная крона (3.2)

- Лиственные породы: частичное опадание **`leaves-grown`** осенью, почки весной на **`log-grown`** и **`leavesbranchy`**.
- Без своих блоков; только правила на существующих `log-grown` / листьях.
- `EnableSeasonalFoliage` — по умолчанию включено.

### Атмосфера под кроной (3.5)

- Клиентские частицы: зелёная пыль весной/летом, опадающие листья осенью.
- Только клиент; `EnableCanopyAmbience`.

### Справочник (3.6)

- Девять страниц переписаны (en/ru): обзор, цветы, папоротники, деревья, ягоды, водные, сезонная крона, осмотр, настройки.
- Цифры по видам — в справочнике блока и в осмотре.

### Настройки

- `OnlyActivateNearPlayers` по умолчанию **false** — экология во **всех загруженных** чанках. **true** — только для локального теста производительности.

### Без изменений (если уже играли на 3.1.12)

- Грибница, mat-распространение тростника и кувшинки, сбор луга, сукцессия почвы, сторонние моды через `ecologyParticipant`, автодополнение конфига.
